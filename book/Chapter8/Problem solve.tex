	\subsection*{8.1-1}
	The smallest depth of a leaf is 1, in the case that the sequence only has 2 elements in the right order and you only have to compare once.
	\subsection*{8.1-2}
	Use induction:
	\\If
	$$ \sum_{1}^{n}(\lg k) = \Omega(n\lg\\n)$$
	$$\Omega(n\lg n) + \lg(n+1) > (n+1)\lg\\n$$
	$$c(n+1)\lg\\n = (n+1)\lg\\n^c > (n+1)\lg(n+1)$$
	for $c\geq 2$
	\subsection*{8.1-3}
	If m of the n! permutations are linear, then the heap consisting this m permutations will have $\lg(m)$ levels. Plug in the fractions, $1/2, 1/n, 1/2^n$ in the heap, all cannot beat the height down to linear. 
	\subsection*{8.1-4}
	Optimal solution doesn't need to compare the elements in different subsequences. n/k sequences in total, $\Omega(k\lg(k))$ for each, so in total is $\Omega(n\lg(k))$
