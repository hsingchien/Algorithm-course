    "for a n-array assume n is even, firstly divide the array into two same sized part. pair-wised compare the two sets, and collect the larger elements into the second half of the array and smaller ones in the first half. do the recursion until the subarray size is no more than 2i. assume that we are proceding the last step where $n/4 < i$, then for the smaller set of size n/2, do the partition select of i_th element, meanwhile, swap their larger counterparts in the other half. this will divide the small array into 3 parts: pre-pivot, pivot and post-pivot. and as for their larger counterparts in the large array, we know that $postpivot counterparts \\geq postpivot \\geq pivot$. so these elements are ruled out for the candidates, together with the post-pivot ones in the small subarray. the i_th element must be within the two pre-pivot subsets of n/2 each. merge the two, total time consumption is n/2 for the first pairwise comparison, U(n/2) for the recursion and T(2i) for the final partition selection in this 2i subarray."
